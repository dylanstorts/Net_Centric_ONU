            <h1>Viz Anime</h1>
            <p>
                Viz is the website of a company that made my favorite cartoon of my late childhood
                known as Inuyasha. I strongly encourage anyone with free time to follow the link and
                search Inuyasha there. Then, you will be able to stream every single episode for free
                and enjoy days of binging on a medieval Japanese adventure of the ages. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In a gist, the story is about a teenage, Japanese girl, named Kagome, who gets pulled into a well that sends
                her 500 years into the past! There, she faces feudal era threats such as demons, bandits and 
                even evil spirits. Eventually she meets a half-demon named Inuyasha who initially seems power
                hungry for a sacred jewel that grants any wish. During the feud for this jewel between Inuyasha and
                Kagome they accidentally shattered the jewel and shards spread in all directions toward every corner of Japan 
                during its explosion. Then they find that Kagome has spiritual powers that allow her to see and sense the jewel 
                shards. Inuyasha then cools down and joins Kagome as he is the only one with the strength to fight the demons 
                that possess the shards and retrieve them. As their journey continues however, they get much more than they 
                bargained for.
